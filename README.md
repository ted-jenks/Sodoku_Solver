# Sodoku Solver

This repo contains the file associated with programming a brute force based sudoku solver in C++.

A recursive method was used to give a clear and readable layout to the code.

Extension work was done in trying to formulate a way of assessing puzzle difficulty. This is discussed in findings.txt.
